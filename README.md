# Neutrino Detection at DUNE
Repository for UROP with Neutrino Physics Group, 2022

This code was written for a research project undertaken in the summer of my 2nd year at university, trying to simulate energy spectra we could see at 
DUNE of neutrinos from astrophysical events, maximum distance an event could be that we could expect to see neutrinos from and if there was angular 
dependence.

Geometries2.py is the file with geometry classes 'spherical' and 'torus', so choose which to use depending on whether your event is modelled as 
spherical or horn torus.

luminosities2.py is where all the functions for calculations and plotting are contained. 

trial.py is the code I ran to obtain results for my project, and gives you an idea of what the code can do.

Please note that I am not a computer science student or a professional coder, so this probably isn't the most efficient way of doing everything. Feel free
to send me suggestions on how to improve it, and edit it yourself for whatever projects you are doing.
